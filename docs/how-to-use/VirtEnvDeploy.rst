Use launcher.py to deploy and clean up example environments.  These examples are described in YAML files.

#. Add your OpenStack connection information to the deploy-complex-network.yaml.

    Edit <path to repo>/examples/complex-network/deploy-complex-network.yaml

            this file
         -  port\_name: The name of the port from which to extract the
