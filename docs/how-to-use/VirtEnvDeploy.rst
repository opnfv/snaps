Use launcher.py to deploy and clean up example environments.  These examples are described in YAML files.

#. Add your OpenStack connection information.

    Edit <path to repo>/examples/inst-w-volume/deploy-env.yaml with your OpenStack
    credentials and authorization URL

#. Deploy the launcher.

    ::

      python launch.py -t ./inst-w-volume/deploy-vm-with-volume.yaml -e ./inst-w-volume/deploy-env.yaml -d

#. Clean the deployment.

    ::

      python launch.py -t ./complex-network/deploy-complex-network.yaml -e ./inst-w-volume/deploy-env.yaml -c

#. Customize the deployment by changing the yaml file.

                the specified address to the port. (optional)
             -  seurity\_groups: A list of security group IDs (optional)
             -  allowed\_address\_pairs: A dictionary containing a set of
                zero or more allowed address pairs. An address pair contains
                an IP address and MAC address. (optional)
             -  opt\_value: The extra DHCP option value (optional)
             -  opt\_name: The extra DHCP option name (optional)
             -  device\_owner: The ID of the entity that uses this port. For
                example, a DHCP agent (optional)
             -  device\_id: The ID of the device that uses this port. For
                example, a virtual server (optional)

       -  floating\_ips: list of floating\_ip configurations (optional)

          -  floating\_ip:
          -  name: Must be unique for VM instance (required)
          -  port\_name: The name of the port requiring access to the
             external network (required)
          -  subnet\_name: The name of the subnet contains the IP address on
             the port on which to create the floating IP (optional)
          -  router\_name: The name of the router connected to an external
             network used to attach the floating IP (required)
          -  provisioning: (True\|False) Denotes whether or not this IP can
             be used for Ansible provisioning (default True)

-  ansible: Each set of attributes below are contained in a list

   -  playbook\_location: Full path or relative to the directory in
      which the deployment file resides (required)
   -  hosts: A list of hosts to which the playbook will be executed
      (required)
   -  variables: Should your Ansible scripts require any substitution
      values to be applied with Jinga2templates, the values defined here
      will be used to for substitution
   -  tag name = substitution variable names. For instance, for any file
      being pushed to the host being provisioned containing a value such
      as {{ foo }}, you must specify a tag name of "foo"

      -  vm\_name:
      -  type: string\|port\|os\_creds\|vm-attr (note: will need to make
         changes to deploy\_venv.py#\_\_get\_variable\_value() for
         additional support)
      -  when type == string, an tag name "value" must exist and its
         value will be used for template substituion
      -  when type == port, custom code has been written to extract
         certain assigned values to the port:

         -  vm\_name: must correspond to a VM's name as configured in
            this file
         -  port\_name: The name of the port from which to extract the
            substitution values (required)
         -  port\_value: The port value. Currently only supporting
            "mac\_address" and "ip\_address" (only the first)

      -  when type == os\_creds, custom code has been written to extract
         the file's connection values:

         -  username: connection's user
         -  password: connection's password
         -  auth\_url: connection's URL
         -  project\_name: connection's project

      -  when type == vm-attr, custom code has been written to extract
         the following attributes from the vm:

         -  vm\_name: must correspond to a VM's name as configured in
            this file
         -  value -> floating\_ip: is currently the only vm-attr
            supported
