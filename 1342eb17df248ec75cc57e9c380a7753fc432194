      "message": "Steven\nAfter out F2F discussions at meet up and Demo of Stack object in snap-oo library and used by FUNCTEST here is my suggestions.\nPlease add an optional dnssec_key to constructor as many use cases need this. Please refer Metswitch clearwate-heat template for vims which is our use case in OPNFV.\nhttps://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-heat\nrefer on link the last section: Clearwater Heat Template.\nSince  I will be using the heat_utility please update and submit-oo asap. This is required to be part of FUNCTEST for us to be able to test.If there is any dependency of this patch on the other two I will review but make sure all needed patches are include to support snap-oo for heat stack create, inspect/check , list, delete a minimum to be used for clearwater deploy and live testing. I will also add Oliver from Orange to review.  Prakash",

      "message": "This two vm floaing ip is good for standard vping testing. Whether this applicable to stack creation and stress testing oliver mentioned and Yuyang was asking for opensource traffic generator  in test-wg need to verify. But that\u0027s the reason we need these heat library included in FUNCTEST even if t\u0027s called experimental to allow for Continuous testing in OPNFV. So all changes need not be taken upfront, we can discover and add more features as we progress to OPNFV  E \u0026 F releases to consolidate with real life use cases like vIMS, vCPE, vOLTE etc. to be usable by OPNFV and other upstreams.",
